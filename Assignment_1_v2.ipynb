    "For this assignment, we will explore Twitter Emotion Classification. The goal is the identify the primary emotion expressed in a tweet. Consider the following tweets:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tweet 1: @NationalGallery @ThePoldarkian I have always loved this painting.\n",
    "Tweet 2: '@tateliverpool #BobandRoberta: I am angry more artists that have a profile are not speaking up #foundationcourses.'\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "How would you describe the emotions in `Tweet 1` vs `Tweet 2`? `Tweet 1` expresses enjoyment and happiness, while `Tweet 2` directly expresses anger. For this assignment, we will be working with the SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1619/paper3.pdf)). At a high level, our goal is to develop different models (rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning), which can be used to identify the emotion of a tweet. You will be required to clean and preprocess the data, generate features for classification, train various models, and evaluate the models. \n",

    "## Task 2: Naive Baseline Using a Rule-based Classifier [10 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a dataset, let's work on developing some solutions for emotion classification. We'll start with implementing a simple rule-based classifier which will also serve as our naive baseline. Emotive language (e.g. awesome, feel great, super happy) can be a strong signal as to the overall emotion being by the tweet. For each emotion in our label space (happy, surprised, sad, angry) we will generate a set of words and phrases that are often associated with that emotion. At classification time, the classifier will calculate a score based on the overlap between the words in the tweet and the emotive words and phrases for each of the emotions. The emotion label with the highest overlap will be selected as the prediction and if there is no match the \"no-emotion\" label will be predicted. We can break the implementation of this rules-based classifier into three steps:\n",
    "1. Emotive language extraction from train examples \n",
    "2. Developing a scoring algorithm\n",
    "3. Building the end-to-end classification flow \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2a. Emotive Language Extraction [4 points] \n",
    "For this task you will generate a set of unigrams and bigrams that will be used to predict each of the labels. Using the training data you will need to extract all the unique unigrams and bigrams associated with each label (excluding no-emotion). Then you should ensure that the extracted terms for each emotion label do not appear in the other lists. In the real world, you would then manually curate the generated lists to ensure that associated words were useful and emotive. For the assignment, you won't be required to further curate the generated lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've identified the appropiate terms, save them as lists stored in the following environment variables: `happy_words`, `surprised_words`, `sad_words`,and `angry_words`. To get full credit for this section, ensure all 2a Tests pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints\n",
    "- We suggest you use Python's [set methods](https://realpython.com/python-sets/) for this task.\n",
    "- NLTK has a function for extracting [ngrams](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.util.html?highlight=ngrams#nltk.util.ngrams). This function expects a list of tokens as input and will output tuples which you'll need to reconvert into strings. "

    "In this case, I would recommend the pre-trained DistilBERT model instead of the RandomForestClassification model and Rule-Based model. Because it has better performance than the results of RandomForestClassification as we can see from the classification report. In addition, DistilBERT is powerful as it retains 90% of BERT's performance. The Rule-Based model implemented in this case has the lowest accuracy. The advantage of this model is fast decision-making, however, the number of classes it has is limited and it won't learn when there is a new class appears. The RandomForestClassification model we implemented can learn the knowledge during the training process but is limited in the imbalanced datasets. The DistilBERT model we implement can learn knowledge during the training process and it can decrease the influence of the imbalanced dataset as it consists of a pre-trained model and a classifier. Therefore, it can just fine-tune the parameters to have good performance. However, DistilBERT requires a longer time to train and its results are not very accurate as it is a general model instead of a specific domain model."
